Behavioral: Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method, Iterator, Chain of Responsibility, Mediator, Memento, Visitor, Interpreter
🏆 Traffic Light Controller Case Study
The repository centers around a Traffic Light Controller API that demonstrates:
•✅ State management for multiple directions (North, South, East, West)
•✅ Validation of conflicting directions (never green simultaneously)
•✅ Command pattern for changing sequences, pausing, resuming
•✅ Observer pattern for state change notifications
•✅ Thread-safe concurrent operations
•✅ Timing history and state queries
•✅ Extensible design for future expansion
See exercises/traffic_light_controller/ for incremental implementations.
🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)
All examples follow TDD principles:
1.Red - Write a failing test
2.Green - Write minimal code to pass
3.Refactor - Improve code while keeping tests green
Example TDD workflow:
# tests/test_traffic_light.py
def test_no_conflicting_green_lights():
    controller = TrafficLightController()
    controller.set_green('NORTH')

    with pytest.raises(ConflictError):
        controller.set_green('EAST')  # Should raise - conflicts with NORTH
📊 Assessment Rubric
Use this rubric to evaluate implementations:
Criteria	Poor (1)	Fair (2)	Good (3)	Excellent (4)
Problem Analysis	Incomplete	Partial	Mostly correct	Complete, insightful
Architecture	Ad hoc	Some structure	Clear structure	Modular, extensible
Code Readability	Hard to read	Somewhat readable	Readable	Very clear, well-documented
Edge Cases	None	Some	Most	All, with creative solutions
Test Coverage	Minimal	Some	Good	Comprehensive, TDD evident
Concurrency Safety	Unsafe	Some issues	Mostly safe	Fully safe, well-justified
